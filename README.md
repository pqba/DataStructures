# Data Structure Collection

A project aimed at learning, implementing, and demonstrating various data structures with their common applications.

## Features

### Data Structures

- Stack: Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.
- Queue: First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure.
- Singly Linked List: Linear collection with each element pointing to the next.
- Doubly Linked List: Similar to singly linked list but with elements pointing to both next and previous.
- Binary Search Tree: Hierarchical structure for fast searching, insertion, and deletion.

### Common

- Reverse Polish Notation Calculator: Evaluate mathematical expressions in postfix notation.
- Music Player: Basic implementation of a music player.
- Event Handler System: Manage and handle events efficiently.

## Usage

1. Compile the project using `make all`.
2. Run the main executable with `bin/main_executable`.
3. Clean up object and binary files with `make clean`.
4. For debugging, use `make debug` for tracing or `make run_debug` with [lldb](https://lldb.llvm.org/).

## File Structure

- **src/**: Source code `.cpp` files for data structures and common features.
- **include/**: Header files `.h` files for declaring classes and functions.
- **bin/**: Binary executable files.
- **obj/**: Object files generated during compilation.
- **test/**: Test files for verifying data structure implementations.
