<h1> Data Structures </h1>
<em>A project to learn about, create use cases of, and generally construct useful data structures. </em>

## Features
This repository includes implementations for:

* Stack
* Queue
* Singly Linked List


## Usage

Use the classes by creating a .cpp file of your liking in the /uses folder, and then linking and compiling with:
 <code> g++ -I../ -o your_implementation your_implementation.cpp ../Data_Structure_Used.cpp ../Data_Structure_Used_2.cpp </code><br>
 and then: <code>.\your_implementation</code>

Then run and  execute your code, and ensure the correct header files are included, and try out the structures for yourself. You can also change the <b>'Data'</b> class <em>(.cpp and .h)</em> to perform operations and create structures of your own defined Data.
